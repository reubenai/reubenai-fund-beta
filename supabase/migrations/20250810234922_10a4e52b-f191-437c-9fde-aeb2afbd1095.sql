-- FINAL SECURITY CLEANUP: Remove all remaining risks
-- 1. Handle the deleted profile safely
-- First check if mike@gilesonline.com has any critical data we need to preserve

-- Transfer any critical data from deleted profile to a system account if needed
-- For now, we'll properly mark it as deleted and ensure it can't be used

UPDATE public.profiles 
SET 
  is_deleted = true,
  role = 'viewer', -- Ensure minimal permissions
  updated_at = now()
WHERE email = 'mike@gilesonline.com';

-- 2. Create a final verification query to ensure all users are properly configured
-- and remove any remaining security gaps

-- 3. Add a final safety constraint to prevent deleted profiles from being used
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_profile_not_deleted()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.is_deleted = true AND TG_OP = 'INSERT' THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Cannot create deleted profile';
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create trigger to prevent accidental creation of deleted profiles
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS profile_deletion_check ON public.profiles;
CREATE TRIGGER profile_deletion_check
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON public.profiles
  FOR EACH ROW
  WHEN (NEW.is_deleted = true)
  EXECUTE FUNCTION check_profile_not_deleted();

-- 4. Final RLS verification - ensure service role queries are handled properly
-- Add a note that service role access is expected for admin functions
COMMENT ON TABLE public.funds IS 'RLS enabled. Service role access is expected for admin operations via admin_get_all_funds_with_orgs function';

-- 5. Ensure all critical tables have proper RLS
DO $$
BEGIN
  -- Verify RLS is enabled on all critical tables
  IF NOT (SELECT pg_class.relrowsecurity FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'funds') THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'RLS not enabled on funds table';
  END IF;
  
  IF NOT (SELECT pg_class.relrowsecurity FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'deals') THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'RLS not enabled on deals table';
  END IF;
  
  IF NOT (SELECT pg_class.relrowsecurity FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'profiles') THEN
